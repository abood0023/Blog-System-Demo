Other cities should take note and set up similar safeguards to protect people\'s safety and civil rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote was passed by San Francisco’s supervisors 8-1, with two absentees. The measure is expected to be officially passed into city law after a second vote next week.\r\n\"Instead of an outright ban, we believe a moratorium would have been more appropriate,\" said Joel Engardio, vice-president of Stop Crime SF.\r\n\r\n\"We agree there are problems with facial recognition ID technology and it should not be used today. But the technology will improve and it could be a useful tool for public safety when used responsibly. We should keep the door open for that possibility.\"\r\n\r\nThe new rules will not apply to security measures at San Francisco’s airport or sea port, as they are run by federal, not local, agencies.\r\n\r\nSome campaigners unsuccessfully urged for the measures not to apply to local police. While San Francisco’s officers do not currently use facial recognition technology, a number of other police forces across the US do.'),

But the tech giants may need to invest in extra computer servers if the software patches involved take a major toll on performance.\r\n\r\n\'Complex undertaking\'\r\nZombieload was discovered by researchers at Graz University of Technology in Austria and KU Leuven university in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThey said it could allow hackers to steal sensitive data or provide the means to unscramble encrypted files.\r\n\r\n\"[This could affect] user-level secrets, such as browser history, website content, user keys, and passwords, or system-level secrets, such as disk encryption keys,\" they explained.\r\n\r\nThey added that it was currently unclear whether any such attack would leave a trace, or if anyone had actually exploited the flaw to date.\r\n\r\nIntel has said that it believes that carrying out such an attack would be \"a very complex undertaking\" but is recommending that users download security updates from Microsoft, Apple and Linux-based operating system providers that will address the issue.\r\n\r\nThe chip-maker has indicated that the biggest performance hit is likely to involve data centre servers handling tasks that use the programming language Java.\r\n\r\nOne graph shows such activity running at 81% of the speed it used to, once a software patch has been applied.\r\n\r\nBut Apple has warned that its own tests have shown as much as a 40% reduction in performance when Macs handle certain computing-intensive workloads.\r\n\r\nClaims that earlier patches to address Spectre and Meltdown would make people\'s computers feel sluggish proved to be largely overstated, although some users have reported problems.'),

Which is scary and bad, because this is in every important Cisco product. Everything.\"\r\n\r\nSecurity experts believe that the vulnerability could cause a major headache for Cisco, which has listed dozens of its products as vulnerable on its website.\r\n\r\n\"We don\'t know how many devices could have been affected and it\'s unlikely Cisco can tell either,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer security expert based at Surrey University.\r\n\r\n\"It could cost Cisco a lot of money.\"\r\n\r\nCisco to cut up to 5,500 jobs\r\nVodafone denies Huawei Italy security risk\r\nWhatsApp discovers surveillance attack\r\nSome have questioned why such a hack was possible in the first place.\r\n\r\nMost companies use hardware where critical security functions exist in a \"read only\" configuration, meaning that the code in the chip cannot be altered once manufactured, said security expert Andrew Tierney of Pen Test partners.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s a questionable design decision that Cisco hasn\'t done this.\"\r\n\r\nThe solutions available are limited, said Mr Tierney.\r\n\r\n\"I can\'t see how a regular user could check whether their device has been hacked and I can\'t see a way users could secure a compromised device.\"\r\n\r\nCisco says that because it is repairing a piece of hardware, a fix will require \"on-premise reprogramming.\"\r\n\r\nThe company wrote on its website that it is \"in the process of developing and releasing software fixes for all affected platforms.\"'),

(8, 1, 'Ex-Google boss defends multiple controversies', 'Former Google boss Eric Schmidt has defended the company’s record on multiple controversies: its work in China, its treatment of women, and its tax affairs.\r\n\r\nThe 64-year-old executive, who sits on the board at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said the tech giant was right to pursue opportunities in China, despite heavy criticism from senior US officials.\r\n\r\n\"The world is a very interconnected place,” Mr Schmidt told BBC Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis.\r\n\r\n\"There are many, many benefits interacting, among other things, with China.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Joseph Dunford, who as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff is the highest ranking American in uniform, said Google’s work \"indirectly benefits the Chinese military and creates a challenge for us in maintaining a competitive advantage\".\r\n\r\nMr Schmidt dismissed the concern.\r\n\r\n\"That\'s like saying America makes pencils and pencils are used by the Chinese.”\r\n\r\nChinese ambition\r\n\r\nGoogle has had a tumultuous history in China. It left the country in 2010 over concerns it was being by censored and cyber-attacked by Beijing, and instead set up an operation in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nMr Schmidt said he disagreed with that move.\r\n\r\n“I believed they would be better to stay in China, and help change China to be more open.”\r\n\r\nMore recently, the company has been building a presence in the country once again, with an estimated 700 employees now working on advertising and other development. In 2017, it established the Google AI China Center, in Shanghai.\r\n\r\nGoogle exploring \'censored\' China search app\r\n\r\nLeaks chip away at Google\'s secrecy on China\r\n\r\nLast year, reporting from The Intercept and New York Times revealed Google had been working on a project named Dragonfly, a search engine that would reportedly fall in line with Beijing’s requirements.\r\n\r\nIt was highly controversial, and prompted high-profile resignations, and a letter of protest signed by 1,400 Google employees.\r\n\r\nThe company has since said it was no longer working on the project.\r\n\r\nWhen asked why most Google employees only learned of Dragonfly via media reports, Mr Schmidt said he had no direct involvement in the project, but that “I can tell you that certainly the people who were building all these products knew about it”.\r\n\r\nEmployee discontent\r\n\r\nMr Schmidt ran Google as chief executive and chairman from 2001 to 2011, then executive chairman until 2015. He then became executive chairman of Alphabet, the company set up as Google’s parent.\r\n\r\nIn that time, the Google\'s motto transitioned from, famously, “Don’t be evil” into “do the right thing”. Over the past 12 months, employee discontent has challenged that notion both internally and externally. Last November, staff at Google offices globally staged a walk-out over issues surrounding gender equality at the firm.\r\n\r\nThe protest took place after a New York Times investigation discovered Google had quietly paid former executive Andy Rubin $90m in severance, despite there being a credible claim of sexual harassment made against him.\r\n\r\nMr Schmidt told Newsnight the firm’s employees protested because they felt empowered.\r\n\r\n“Transparency is a virtue,” Mr Schmidt said.\r\n\r\n\"And the fact of the matter is that if we had tried to suppress this stuff it would have come out anyway. It\'s much better to encourage people to express their opinions.\r\n\"We would argue that [the protests show] our culture at work. Google is famously empowering of its employees and we want to hear from them. These are cases where the employees collectively felt very strongly about the decisions that the company had made.”\r\n\r\nA follow-up protest took place last month after organisers of November’s walk-out claimed they were being punished for their activism.\r\n\r\n\"My manager started ignoring me,” wrote Clare Stapleton, a Google employee in New York, in an internal memo obtained by Wired magazine. “My work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick.”\r\n\r\nTax complaint\r\n\r\nMr Schmidt stepped down as Alphabet’s chairman in 2017, but remained on the board. Last month, he said he would be leaving the firm altogether in June.\r\n\r\nThroughout his tenure, the tax affairs of Google - like other tech giants - have been under close scrutiny. The company has always maintained that it adheres to the tax laws in all of the countries that it operates in.\r\n\r\nDocuments filed in the Netherlands showed Google moved 19.9 billion euros (£17.9bn, $22.7bn) to a shell company in Bermuda, a tax haven. Mr Schmidt told the BBC he was happy the company’s tax affairs were ethical.\r\n\r\n“We are required to follow the tax rules, and the tax rules allow that,” he said.\r\n\r\n\"When those tax rules change of course we will adopt them. But there is a presumption that somehow we\'re doing something wrong here. We’re following the global tax regime.”\r\n\r\nHe added: “Would you like us to give more, voluntarily, to these governments?\r\n\r\n“I will defend the company and the way it works for a very long time.\"'),

On a cold day, species good at heating themselves will be active earlier - feeding, mating and defending their territory,\" he said.\r\n\r\nDr Bladon said butterflies able to regulate their body temperature relative to air temperature were less likely to be affected by climate change, allowing conservationists to predict which would be vulnerable.\r\nThe team also examined micro-climates - pockets of air at a higher or lower temperature than the surrounding air - to understand how different habitats could provide ways for butterflies to warm or cool themselves.\r\n\r\nBeneficial micro-climates could then be created and maintained in nature reserves, researchers suggest.\r\n\r\nThe chalk grassland site at Totternhoe was chosen as it is home to half the butterfly species recorded in the UK.\r\n\r\nA Wildlife Trust spokesman said the collaborative project would \"guide its future reserve management strategies\".');
